d_frompy: a tool for automatic translation of python code to the D programming language
written 2014 by Laeeth Isharc

very basic hack to make another job easier.  proper design using standard concepts for lexer/parser (and use of existing
libraries for parsing python) would make the most sense.  but in this case something very basic brings a good part of the
value of the full thing, and I do not have time for doing it properly at this stage.
